/**
 * Method 1 — 45 items, flat, one score per campus. Re-synced 2026-08-22
 * (Round 3 Task 10) against the live "MQI Assessment Rubrics (Method 1)"
 * sheet — every count/name/weight below is a direct fetch, not carried over
 * from any earlier round of this brief (which had gone stale). Changes from
 * the previous 44-item version:
 *   - New 22nd Functionality item "Drinking Water Cooler & Filter *" (2%),
 *     funded by Cabinet and Soft board each dropping 3% -> 2%.
 *   - "W.Cs/Commodes *" lost its asterisk (no longer principal-maintained) —
 *     matches what method2-items.ts already had; Method 1's copy was stale.
 *   - "Toilet Flooring condition" renamed to "Toilet Tile condition".
 * Safety is unchanged (still 14 items, same weights as the 2026-08-12 audit).
