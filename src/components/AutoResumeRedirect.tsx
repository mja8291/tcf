/**
 * Mounted on Home only. SurveyProvider's own mount effect (see
 * survey-context.tsx's ACTIVE_SURVEY_STORAGE_KEY) already auto-loads an
 * in-progress survey from IndexedDB into `state` the moment it detects the
 * pointer — that part happens regardless of which page triggered the
 * mount, Home included, now that the provider covers the whole app. What's
 * missing without this component: Home doesn't otherwise know or care that
 * happened, so a cold start (the actual, common scenario this exists for —
 * Android killing the app under memory pressure while offline, surveyor
 * reopens it, PWA start_url is always "/") would just... sit there on
 * Home, survey silently loaded into memory but nothing on screen reflecting
 * it except needing to notice and tap the right entry in DraftsBanner.
 * This finishes the job: the moment hydration confirms there's a live
 * survey, jump straight back into it, same as reopening any other app
 * would land you where you left off.
